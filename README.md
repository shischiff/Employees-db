Instructions for CI/CD:

**GIT: Clone, Code, Push**

* Develop some cool features, don't forget to write tests
* Commit your changes and push them

**Fully Automated Pipeline:**

* From here it's all automatic...  the code will be going through: containeraizing, build, test
* If tests are passed the new docker image will be pushed to dockerhub and then deployed in our cloud production environment 
* If tests failed you will be notified. fix your code and try again :-)

* check out the new app in http://\<EC2 IP>:3000
